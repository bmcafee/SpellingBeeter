# SpellingBeeter
A solver for the NYT Spelling Bee game, for those who like cheating.

Just run the R script "Spelling_Beeter.R" and it will prompt you for the letters of the game.

I wrote this as a challenge to myself to try and find the fastest way to filter and sort large dataframes in R.
Have fun
